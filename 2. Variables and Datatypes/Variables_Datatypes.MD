# **Python Variables and Datatypes**
Variables are used to store data values. Each variable in Python has a data type, which determines the kind of data it can hold.

There are various datatypes including:
* Integer
* Float
* Boolean
* String
* List
* Tuple
* Dictionary
* Set
* Complex

### **Integer Datatype**
We can use `int` datatype to represent whole numbers.

```py
a = 10
print(a)
print(type(a))
```
**Output:**
10
<class 'int'>

We can represent `int` values in the following ways.
* Decimal (base = 10)
* Binary (base = 2)
* Octal (base = 8)
* Hexa-Decimal (base = 16)

If we need to do the convert the base then we use the in-built functions of python:
* `bin()`: It convert from any base to binary.
* `oct()`: It convert from any base to octal.
* `hex()`: It converts from any base to hexadecimal.
